## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Production Build
```bash
npm run build:prod
npm run preview
```

### 2. Run Linting
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### 3. Verify Assets

- [ ] Icons spawn and are clickable
- [ ] Level progression works
- [ ] Full-screen mode functions
- [ ] Error boundaries catch issues gracefully

### 5. Performance Check
```bash
npm run analyze
```
- [ ] Bundle size under 1MB for main chunks
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies included
- [ ] Proper code splitting implemented

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Static Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and deploy to Vercel
npm run build:prod
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to Netlify
npm run build:prod
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
```

### Container Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t nasa-frontend .

# Run container
docker run -p 80:80 nasa-frontend
```

### Manual Server Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Copy dist/ folder to your web server
# Configure nginx/apache to serve SPA correctly
```
